This is the code for a Coding Assignment conducted in the MLDL (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) course at GIST (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology). 
(2024 March ~ 2024 June)

The code is related to an SVM (Support Vector Machine) problem, and the "MLDL_CA_report.pdf" file contains reflections on the performance of each SVM model as well as interpretations of the code. 

The code includes implementations of Hard Margin SVM, Soft Margin SVM, and various Kernel (RBF, Sigmoid, etc.) SVM models.
